In this repository is a series of programs I have made and am currently developing
to assist me in my Japanese studies.

These programs range in complexity and function, from basic single word vocab testing
to larger randomly generated vocab tests and practice sentence creation.

The lenghtiest part of this creation process is the cretion of python vocab dictionaries
as this requieres extensive writing and use of correct Japanese script. As such, these
vocab dictionaries will be updated at unspecified intervals.
