# PythonJapaneseProjects
An assortment of Japanese Language learning programs I am working on.
The vocab dicitionaries available are currently quite limited as I wrote the testing functions prior to creating an extensive library of vocab.
Each of the basic vocab testing functions has a corresponding vocab file from which can be imported.
The larger vocab tester function currently imports the verbs2 dictionary from japaneseVerbVocab.py as this contatins a larger dictionary with vocab in Japanese Script. Over time
I shall expand the list of available vocab dictionaries.
